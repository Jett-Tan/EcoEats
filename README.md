# EcoEats

## Overview

**EcoEats** is a sustainable food delivery platform that connects users with eco-friendly restaurants and meal providers. Our mission is to promote sustainable eating habits by prioritizing restaurants that use organic ingredients, minimal packaging, and sustainable sourcing methods.

EcoEats aims to minimize food waste while promoting affordability and sustainability by helping consumers access discounted surplus food. By developing a digital platform, we facilitate the redistribution of surplus food from businesses to consumers at discounted rates or zero cost, thereby minimizing waste.

Through this platform, consumers can easily locate nearby stores offering end-of-day discounted food items, providing them with affordable meal options while enabling business owners to make final sales or give away surplus food instead of discarding it. This mutually beneficial solution addresses both the economic and environmental impacts of food wastage while fostering a more sustainable and efficient food distribution system.
